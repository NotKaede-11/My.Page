        <div class="philosophy-text">
          <p>
            I chose to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science because
            of my passion for web development and programming. The idea of
            creating websites and building functional systems excites me, and I
            believe that learning how to program is not just a valuable skill
            but also a fun and fulfilling experience. The more I dive into the
            complexities of coding, the more I feel like I’m not just learning
            but building the future I want for myself.<br />
            <br />
            What motivates me the most is the sense of accomplishment I get
            after completing a task, no matter how big or small. Each project
            feels like a significant achievement, and the feeling of learning
            something new is one of the greatest rewards in life. It pushes me
            to keep going, knowing that every step forward brings me closer to
            mastery.<br />
            <br />
            My ultimate goal is to become a successful web developer, but I
            don’t want to stop there. I envision myself creating my own
            programs—whether it's a chess engine, AI, chatbot, or even my own
            games. I want to expand my knowledge and skills in a way that allows
            me to bring my ideas to life.<br />
            <br />
            When it comes to learning, I believe in taking things slowly. I
            prefer to break down complex topics into manageable parts, making it
            easier for me to understand and retain information. I also embrace
            trial and error because mistakes are an essential part of the
            learning process. This approach helps me grow, not just as a
            student, but as a problem-solver.<br />
            <br />Technology plays a huge role in shaping my perspective. It
            provides me with instant access to information and solutions to the
            challenges I face. It also helps me stay connected with the people I
            care about. Ultimately, technology is the reason I chose Computer
            Science, as it opens up endless possibilities for creativity,
            problem-solving, and connection.
